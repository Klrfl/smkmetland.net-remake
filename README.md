# smkmetland.net remake

![smkmetland.net remake homepage](./public/assets/smkmetland.net-homepage.png)

So basically [smkmetland.net](https://smkmetland.net) is really ugly right now,
so I decided to remake it with Astro. The blog posts are fetched directly from
the original site's Wordpress API and then prebuilt into HTML files. So it's not
going to update when there is a new post.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
